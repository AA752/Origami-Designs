<p> <b>Origami</b> is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words <i>ori</i> (“folding”) and <i>kami</i> (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.</p>
